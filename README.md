# Map_dc


Mapping the two sides of multiple geographies in Washington DC. 
## What to map ?
I want to build a project which examines some environmental and socio-economic factors Washington D.C.

# Where to map? 
The map will focus on Washington D.C., and examine data at the Census Tract level.

# Why map?

This mapping project began as an exploration of the hidden threats posed by leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the D.C. area. 
The intent was to examine and depict the 'what', 'who' and 'where' of these installations, along with the existing and potential impacts
on the general population and the environment.
There are hidden dangers all around us - which are usually unnoticed, or taken for granted. This project will examine the human and economic factors at play. Namely, these are "at risk" populations due to:
1. non-communicable disease
2. socio-economic factors
3. Environmental factors

These factors led to further enquiry to ascertain where the at risk populations are located in relation to the underground storage tanks.
