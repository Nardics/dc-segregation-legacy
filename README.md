Mapping the two sides of multiple geographies in Washington DC. 
## What to map ?
I want to build a project which examines some environmental and socio-economic factors Washington D.C.

# Where to map? 
The map will focus on Washington D.C., and examine census tract-level data.

# Why map?

There are hidden dangers all around us - which are usually unnoticed, or taken for granted. This project will examine the human and economic factors at play. Namely, these are "at risk" populations due to:
1. non-communicable disease
2. socio-economic factors
3. Environmental factors

These factors led to further enquiry to ascertain where the at risk populations are located in relation to the underground storage tanks.
