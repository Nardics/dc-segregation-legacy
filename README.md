# I. Introduction

Washington D.C. has a storied history of segregation.[This is a test(Really)](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/mapping-segregation-fha/)
# D.C.'s Legacy of Segregation


Mapping multiple geographies in Washington DC. 
## What to map ?
Redlining was a system of unofficially grading portions cities according to several factors, including human and economic.
The policies and practices intentionally deprived African-American and other households of color,thus limiting their acess to homeownership and opportunities to build wealth.  
Unwittingly, the practice has left a legacy of obscure/inconspicuous geographies in its wake across the continental United States. Interestingly, according to the [D.C. Policy Center](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/mapping-segregation-fha/), no map of redlining exists in the National Archives.
I want to build a project which highlights some environmental and socio-economic factors, which may be legacy effects of the practice of redlining in the city.

# Where to map? 
The map will focus on Washington D.C., and examine the distribution patterns of several metrics
at Census Tract level.

# Why/When map?

This mapping project began as an exploration of the hidden threats posed by leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the D.C. area. 
The intent was to examine and depict the 'what', 'who' and 'where' of these installations, along with the existing and potential impacts on the general population and the environment.

These geographies fell into two (2) broad categories:

1. socio-economic factors
2. Environmental factors

However, the data began to reveal that there was another story to tell - of the above-mentioned geographies.

The data categories were examined from a historical perspective, with the intent of exploring the legacy of 'redlining', to determine any discernable patterns as a result of the practice.

### Sub-categories

As previously mentioned, data was examined at the Census Tract level. Five areas were mapped under socio-economic factors:
1. Income - median income
2. Poverty levels -percentage of the population below the poverty line, for the period under examination
3. Disability
4. Heat Sensitivity Exposure
5. Population distribution (percentage of population who were persons of colour)

Environmental/Physical Factors broached three sub-categories
1. Mean air temperatures
2. Percentage of tree coverage
3. Watersheds
## Explanation of Terms


### Redlining

Redlining refers to the federal government's practice in the 1930s of rating neighborhoods to help mortgage lenders 
determine which areas of a city were considered risky. The federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation made maps and shaded 
neighborhoods red that it deemed "hazardous." That risk level was largely based on the number of African Americans and 
immigrants living there.


### Heat Island
According to the EPA, heat islands "are urbanized areas that experience higher temperatures than outlying areas. 
Structures such as buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun’s heat more than natural 
landscapes such as forests and water bodies. 

Urban areas, where these structures are highly concentrated and greenery is limited, become “islands” of higher 
temperatures relative to outlying areas. Daytime temperatures in urban areas are about 1–7°F higher than temperatures 
in outlying areas and nighttime temperatures are about 2-5°F higher."

Heat islands can form under a variety of conditions, including during the day or night, in small or large cities, in 
suburban areas, in northern or southern climates, and in any season.

### Heat Index
The heat index is also known as the apparent temperature. As defined by the National Weather Service, the heat index 
is "what the temperature feels like to the human body when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature."
