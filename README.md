# Map_dc


Mapping the two sides of multiple geographies in Washington DC. 
## What to map ?
I want to build a project which examines some environmental and socio-economic factors Washington D.C.

# Where to map? 
The map will focus on Washington D.C., and examine data at the Census Tract level.

# Why map?

This mapping project began as an exploration of the hidden threats posed by leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) in the D.C. area. 
The intent was to examine and depict the 'what', 'who' and 'where' of these installations, along with the existing and potential impacts
on the general population and the environment.

Washington D.C has a storied history of segregation. As time elapsed, however, further examination of the data revealed some other patterns which begged to be explored.
These geographies fell into two (2) broad categories, namely:

1. socio-economic factors
2. Environmental factors

The categories were examined from a historical perspective, with the intent of exploring the legacy of 'redlining', to determine
any discernable patterns as a result of the practice.

### Sub-categories

As previously mentioned, data was examined at the Census Tract level. Five areas were mapped under socio-economic factors:
1. Income - median income
2. Poverty levels -percentage of the population below the poverty line, for the period under examination
3. Disability
4. Heat Sensitivity Exposure
5. Population distribution (percentage of population who were persons of colour)

Environmental/Physical Factors broached three sub-categories
1. Mean air temperatures
2. Percentage of tree coverage
3. Watersheds
